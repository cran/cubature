Changes for package cubature

Version 1.0 (2009-12-18)
  - Original version of package based on Steven G. Johnson's cubature
	routines at http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Cubature

Version 1.1 (2011-11-10)
  Changes from previous versions
  - Synced up to SGJ cubature routines dated 2010-10-18 on his website
	http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Cubature
  - Bugfix: potential memory leak fixed up in heap routine (my oversight!)
  - Routine adaptIntegrate gains ... argument (request of Baptiste Auguie)
  - Corrected radius constant in testFn2 to match cubature output exactly

Version 1.1-1 (2011-12-01)
	- Added doChecking argument (default FALSE) to save some
	        computation time in evaluating integrand (9% speedup).

Version 1.1-2 (2011-12-08)
	- Fixed typo in doc for function adaptIntegrate; default value for
		doChecking was incorrectly stated as TRUE

Version 1.1-2 (2013-02-24)
        - Registered native cubature functions adapt_integrate and
        	adapt_integrate_v so that they are directly callable from C
